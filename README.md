## ECE 387 - Mobile App

This repository contains the code for the Android app designed for an ECE 387 (Embedded Systems) lab.

### File Structure

Most of the files in this repository were generated automatically by Android Studio, but I have modified [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/chrisblutz/ece387-mobile-app/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/github/chrisblutz/ece387/MainActivity.java) and [strings.xml](https://github.com/chrisblutz/ece387-mobile-app/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) to add the counter functionality and the button.

### Demonstration

There is a video demonstration [here](https://youtu.be/yWGDNOT3u98) which shows the app being used on my Samsung Galaxy S8.

### Tool Versions

For this project, I used Android Studio Bumblebee v2021.1.1 Patch 2.
